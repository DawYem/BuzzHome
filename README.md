## 📝 Notes

- **This is a mockup only.** No real payments, no real authentication, no database.
- The frontend will function even without the backend running (uses local fallback data).
- Listing form submissions are simulated — data is added to the in-memory array (resets on server restart).
- All listing images are sourced from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) via stable URLs.
